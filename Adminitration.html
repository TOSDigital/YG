                was a blessing in disguise as his interest towards Spiritual Sadhana, Yoga, Vedanta, Nature and
                Farming intensified which one fine day was blossoming as an intuitive thought of starting a
                Gurukulam which will be a spiritual community, yogic retreat and a niche for people who seek a
                meaningful approach towards spirituality, self-empowerment and lifestyle management.

                important role in human life. His skills of communicating philosophy and scriptural wisdom in a very
                creative and practical way with wonderful examples will kindle a new interest and curiosity to listen
                more and more. He very strongly approaches spirituality as a life science and we need to adopt a
                new way to communicate the same with the modern mind. This ideology lead him to meet people
                with similar ideologies, successful businessmen and entrepreneurs who are spiritually inclined and
                can play a major role in realizing his beliefs. The collaboration of ideas with other prestigious
                members of this platform, paved a divine way in establishment of ‘Yogakshema Gurukulam’ which
                is more a Wholesome Wellness Academy than an age old hermitage or monastery.
